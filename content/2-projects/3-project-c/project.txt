Text: Amazon fashion enlisted gates to concept and execute their women’s contemporary campaign and the launch of their first men’s campaign. The challenge was to design the campaigns around amazon’s extensive media buy. To include all sizes and formats, gates wanted to rethink the way that the photography was approached and executed. Amazon’s media buy included magazine spreads, billboards, bus sides, taxi tops, subway, and banner ads. Gates concepted the campaigns around these formats in order to gain a stronger presence and create images that were both dramatic and functional within the space.
