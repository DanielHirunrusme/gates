Text: Ann taylor recently went through a repositioning of their brand. The goal was to push the brand forward and create a consistent visual language and tone of voice. We were challenged to rethink the consumer experience from digital to in-store to have a more editorial point of view in order to engage a new loyal customer. Gates envisioned an opportunity to re-brand and over the course of three seasons created campaigns that told the story of ann taylor. Ann taylor hired gates to concept, produce, direct, and execute their seasonal advertising brand campaigns. Gates defined and developed 360 advertising concepts, including seasonal stories, tone of voice, and taglines. Each campaign was followed through to execution including production, on-set creative direction, post-production, advertising, and digital.
